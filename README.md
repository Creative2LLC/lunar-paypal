A custom PayPal payment driver for the [Lunar](https://lunarphp.io) framework.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require creative2llc/lunar-paypal
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lunar-paypal-views"
```

## Usage

The package ships with a checkout component that allows payment via PayPal Express checkout or via on-site credit card payment.

To add the component to your checkout page, add the following to your checkout page:

```php
<livewire:paypal.payment :cart="$cart"
                         :returnUrl="route('checkout-success.view')" />
```

where `$cart` is the cart instance and `route('checkout-success.view')` is the route to redirect to after a successful payment.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
